# Bellabeat-Case-Study

This project was the capstone to my Google Data Analytics certification where I created an EDA for a mock company. The company is a wellness brand for women with an ecosystem of products and services focused on womenâ€™s health. It was my objective to use FitBit data to gather insights that could improve their line of products and help shape software and future product decisions.
